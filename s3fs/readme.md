# S3FS

![S3FS Logo](ext/icon/128.png "S3FS Logo")

S3FS is a Chrome extension for ChromeOS for accessing files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket directly through the Files app.

## Overview

The project provides the glue between the S3 API and Chrome's `fileSystemProvider` API. Currently this API is read-only, and therefore creating or writing to files in a bucket is not supported. This will be added when the Chrome API is updated.

## Building

First make sure you have Git, Node.js, Google Chrome and Make installed. Then run the following commands.

```
npm install -g  grunt-cli
git clone <repo url>
cd s3fs
make install
```

This will install all the dependencies. You can then run `make zip` to bundle the extension up into a ZIP archive, or `make build` to package it into a `.crx` Chrome extension file.

## Installing

First you'll need to provide the credentials to use to connect to your bucket. Create the file `js/credentials.js` and put the following code into it, replacing the two values.

```js
module.exports = {
  key: 'YOUR KEY HERE',
  secret: 'YOUR SECRET HERE'
};
```

To access it from a locally running instance of ChromiumOS for testing, copy it into your downloads folder. This is accessible from within the ChromiumOS file browser. On Linux the path is the `~/Downloads`, and the building and copying process can be completed in one step by running `make copy`. Then open the ChromiumOS file browser and the Chromium extensions page (at `chrome://extensions`), and drag s3fs.crx across to install it.
