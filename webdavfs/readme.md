# WebDAVFS

WebDAVFS is a Chrome extension for Chrome OS for accessing files via the WebDAV protocol directly through the Files app.

## Overview

The project provides the glue between WebDAV and Chrome's `fileSystemProvider` API. Currently this API is read-only, and therefore creating or writing to files is not supported. This will be added when the Chrome API is updated.

## Building

First clone and configure this repository as described in the main readme. Then run the following commands.

```bash
$ cd webdavfs
$ make install
$ grunt
```

This will install all the dependencies and build the project. You can then run `make zip` to bundle the extension up into a ZIP archive, or install the extension for testing as an unpacked extension by selecting the `extension` directory from Chrome's 'Load unpacked extension' dialog.

## Testing

To run the unit test suite, run `tools/test.sh s3fs` from the top-level directory. Make sure you've followed all the setup instructions in the top-level readme first.

## Documentation

To generate HTML documentation for the provider from the JSDoc source code annotations, run `grunt docs`. The documentation will be generated to the `docs` directory. To view it, run `grunt connect:docs &` and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`.
