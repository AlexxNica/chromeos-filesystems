# ChromeOS Filesystem Providers

[![Build Status][travis image]][travis]

This repository contains various filesystem providers for Chrome OS. They offer a way to access files stored on remote servers through the Files app, via a variety of protocols.

Currently, the provider API itself is read-only, and therefore all of the providers are too. When the API is updated, they can be extended to support write operations.

## Current

Work has started on the following providers

- WebDAV
- Amazon S3
- Dropbox

They can be found in their respective directories with this repository. Please refer to each provider's own readme for installation and usage instructions.

## Planned

There are many more providers we would like to implement, including

- SFTP
- Google Cloud Storage
- Samba
- Git
- Box

## Setup

To work on any of these providers, you will need Git, Node.js, Google Chrome and Make installed. You should also install Grunt and Bower globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli bower
```

Then you can get the repository installed:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/google/chromeos-filesystems
$ cd chromeos-filesystems
$ bower install
```

## Testing

All providers read the files needed by their unit tests from the server in the `testserver` directory. To start it:

```bash
$ cd testserver
$ npm install
$ node server.js &
```

It will then run indefinitely in the background on port 8000. This can be changed by modifying `config.js`.
